How I deal with Todo lists and backing up data

This is how I backup files and directories to Dropbox. 

 - Step 1. Get a Dropbox account.
 - Step 2. Create an org (for organization?) directory. Organize your things in there.
 - Step 3. Copy the code found in the `.bashrc` file to your `~/.bashrc.`
 - Step 4. Run `copy_important`.
