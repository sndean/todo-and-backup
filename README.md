## Things you need:

These include accounts, programs, tools, and directories. Overall, it is only set up to work on macOS, but pieces of it will certain be useable on a Linux machine.

* A Dropbox account
 
  * ~/Dropbox/Notes
  
    * For the todo list, use the todo.org file
      - It may be necessary to specifically put out the top level (grep '* ') for Reminders-based work
      - Possibly use refile-beorg.org for todo list using beorg
  
  * ~/Dropbox/org
